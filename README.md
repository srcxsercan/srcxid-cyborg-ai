# SRCX Blueprint AI

**Autonomous infrastructure intelligence engine for the SRCX global fintech ecosystem.**

Blueprint AI analyzes 105+ repositories, generates infrastructure blueprints, orchestrates deployments, and powers the SRCX satellite network.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### ✅ Repository Intelligence
- Scans all SRCX repositories
- Extracts API endpoints, services, Dockerfiles, Compose files, Makefiles
- Generates `blueprint.json` metadata for each repo

### ✅ Dependency Graph Engine
- Maps service-to-service communication
- Detects API gateways, databases, caches, queues
- Builds a full system topology graph

### ✅ Infrastructure Generators
- Docker Compose generator
- Helm chart generator
- SSL + domain linker
- Reverse proxy + routing builder

### ✅ Satellite Agent
- Lightweight runtime for edge/cloud nodes
- Container engine integration
- Service discovery
- Heartbeat + self-healing

### ✅ Warp Code Deployment Engine
- Multi-environment deployment planner
- Build pipeline generator
- Orchestrator for cloud + local + satellite nodes
